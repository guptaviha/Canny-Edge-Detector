# Canny-Edge-Detector

An academic project for Computer Vision (CS-GY-6643) at NYU Tandon with Prof Edward Wong.

Objective: To implement a canny edge detector from scratch using the Prewitt operator and comprising of the four steps: gaussian smoothening, gradient operation, non-maxima suppression and thresholding. The program accepts a bmp input image and outputs 5 intermidiate images along with 3 final binary edge maps at three thresholds.

## Execution Instructions

1. Ensure python3 is setup on your system.
2. Download the python and image files into a directory.
3. Enter above directory and pass a test image as a parameter to run the program as follows:

```
python3 canny.py 'House.bmp'
```
